I Designed the Menu at start.

I created the namespace MedicalResearchApp and Created Disease Class inside it, which
holds the string type values which the user inputs.

In it I created a void of shallowcopy for Disease class, and then DeepCopy.

In my second Namespace Database, I created Class DiseaseDatabase in which I have written the function of Adding Disease, Symptoms, and patient details.

My third Namespace is UI, it has ENUM, UI class.
This consists Menu Design, Repo, main Test for Console, and have written function to take inputs from the user.

And my last Namespace MedicalConsole, I have done a class App, in which the main Function Test() starts the whole process.

I have written Utilities in other class file, defined GetNumber and string in Utilities.
